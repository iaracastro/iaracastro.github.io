Greetings! I'm Iara Cristina, a 19-year-old studant currently at my last year on the Undergraduate course of Applied Mathematics at FGV-RJ (FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas). Born into a world where academia was not just a profession but a way of life, both my parents served as professors at UENF (Universidade Estadual Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro). Their influence fostered a love for learning and a deep appreciation for the real-world applications of mathematics.

My journey took an exciting turn during high school when I participated in OBMEP (OlimpÃ­ada Brasileira de MatemÃ¡tica) and ONC (OlimpÃ­ada Nacional de CiÃªncias). The challenges intensified my fascination with the beauty of mathematics and its profound connection to our daily lives.

Early on, I embarked on a bilingual journey at Externato Campista, earning two Cambridge Certificates and immersing myself in English and Spanish. Hailing from a Peruvian family, language became not just a tool but a bridge connecting me to a different culture.

In 2020, I grappled with depression following the passing of my mom, my greatest supporter. While my academic pursuits remained resilient, the lens through which I viewed life underwent some transformations.

Fast forward to 2021, stepping into the realms of college life unveiled a newfound love for modeling real life problems and programming. My trajectory is set, and I aspire to pursue a master's degree here aswell.

Recently, I find myself immersed in the dynamic world of finance at BOCOM BBM (Banco de ComunicaÃ§Ãµes) as part of my internship, contributing to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing efforts. Surrounded by seasoned colleagues, I am gaining valuable experience in a renamed institution.

Beyond the world of academia and finance, my heart finds solace in the realms of gaming, piano melodies, and the creation of digital art. As the future beckons with myriad possibilities, my main goal is to explore the infinite avenues STEM has to offer and, in the process, extend a helping hand and share knowledge with fellow teammates.
